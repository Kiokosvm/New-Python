# A variable can have a short name like x or y or a more descriptive name (age,total_volume,carname)
#Rules for python variables:
#  -A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
#  -A variable name cannot start with a number
#  -A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
#  -Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
#  -A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

myvar = "John"
my_var = "Sam"
_my_var = "Lexx"
myVar = "Joy"
MYVAR = "Jilo"
myvar2 = "Miki"

#There are several techniques you can use to make variable names with more than one word more readable:

#Camel Case
myVariableName = "John"
#Pascal Case
MyVariableName = "John"
#Snake Case
my_variable_name = "John"
